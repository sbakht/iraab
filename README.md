## What is it?w

This is a practice tool for primarily beginners to help learn and practice arabic. There will be a search page where a user can look through all the example arabic sentences and their grammar. This page will allow for filters, filtering for difficulty and what type of grammar they include.

Example: A beginner just learn Jumlah Ismmiyah and Mudaf Mudafilayhi. They can filter all the sentences to those that include (only) either or both of those grammar structures, and choose to exclude those that have any other structures. This lets them see and practice with these structures.

The next thing to be added after the databse, is a quiz section, which presents a sentence and the user has to build the grammar of the sentence. This too will include the filtering mechanism so you can choose what you want to be tested on.
